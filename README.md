# Photo-Album

Language: Java

Focuses: GUI, Sockets

Technologies: Swing, AWT, Socket/ServerSockets, Threads

The album class was designed as apart of a class project around GUIs.  Later in the semester we covered sockets and threads so I re implemented the photoalbum atop a multi threaded server.  The whole project took around 2 months to complete.
